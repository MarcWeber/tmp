longer than it should. Same about updating meta data.

By creating a media filesystem which allows JSON like custom tags users and
players will be more happier.
Because it's a filesystem it can offer special views and generate
opus/ogg/flac/mp3/wav/... on the fly if you want to export music for special
use cases such as *OLD car radio* while downsampling the cover image.
So you get /music-export-for-car-x-radio and once you acceess it the PC will
convert on the fly. Once setup easy to work with for everyone.

For changing music such as radio stations each family member can add multiple likes/dislike.
So that its easy to say play what Ben & Anna liked in the past.
Radio stations are special because judgment might only be possible after 3-5
ratings because music can change.

Moreover with machine learning that rating can be used to rate the remaining music.

Please mind that this is only one specialized use case as example what will be
possible.

  gemini -> white label solution for sim cards {{{

  Yes, there are white label solutions available in Germany for SIM cards, particularly in the context of IoT/M2M connectivity and for companies looking to become Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) or resellers.

  Here's a breakdown of what that entails and some providers:

  What is a White Label SIM Card Solution?

  A white label SIM card solution allows a company to offer mobile connectivity services (data, SMS, sometimes voice) under their own brand, without owning or operating the underlying network infrastructure. This is typically achieved by partnering with:

  MVNO Enablers (MVNEs) or Aggregators (MVNAs): These companies provide the platform, technology, and often the wholesale agreements with mobile network operators (MNOs) that allow you to launch your own branded mobile service. They handle the backend complexities like network integration, billing, and technical support.
  IoT Connectivity Providers: Many companies specializing in IoT (Internet of Things) connectivity offer white label SIM solutions for businesses that need to connect their devices (e.g., smart devices, machines, sensors) and want to brand the connectivity as their own.
  Key Aspects of White Label SIM Solutions in Germany:

  Network Access: White label providers typically have agreements with major German network operators (like Telekom, Vodafone, O2) or can aggregate across multiple networks, ensuring broad coverage.
  SIM Management Portals: You'll usually get access to a portal to manage your SIM cards, monitor data usage, activate/deactivate services, and handle billing.
  Customization: The degree of "white label" can vary. It can range from simply reselling a service under your own name to having your logo printed on the SIM cards and a fully branded customer journey.
  eSIM Solutions: Many providers are also offering white label eSIM solutions, which provide even greater flexibility for managing connectivity remotely.
  Focus Areas: While some providers cater to general mobile services, many specialize in IoT/M2M, offering features like static IP addresses, VPN solutions, and flexible data pools tailored for device connectivity.
  Examples of Providers/Concepts in Germany (or with a strong presence/offering in Germany):

  Epsilon (FUSION IoT): They offer "Connectivity-as-a-Service" as a white label solution for manufacturers, allowing them to resell connectivity under their own brand for IoT devices. They highlight independence from traditional network operators and a comprehensive SIM management portal.
  newSIM: Explicitly mentions "White Label Mobilfunk" (White Label Mobile Communications) and "Branded Reseller" on their German website, indicating their focus on enabling other companies to offer mobile services under their own brand.
  White Label SIM (whitelabelsim.com): While they have a global presence, they mention expanding their private-label wireless MVNO programs to numerous countries, including native services, making them a potential option for Germany. They offer a hosted SaaS platform for various mobile services.
  Boxo: Focuses on white label eSIM solutions, allowing mobile apps to embed an eSIM store for their users, providing connectivity in over 200 countries, including Germany.
  eSIM Access: Offers white label eSIM solutions with quick start options, including pre-built eSIM shops and API access for custom sales experiences, operating with global Tier 1 operators (including Deutsche Telekom).
  Things Mobile: While they also sell directly on Amazon.de, they offer SIM cards for IoT and M2M with multi-network connectivity in many countries (including Germany) and APIs for custom integrations, which can be leveraged for white label solutions.
  TNF Solutions: They are an integrated MVNO and IoT solutions partner that offers MVNO white label reseller opportunities, allowing businesses to offer mobile voice, SMS, data, and IoT services under their own brand.
  1GLOBAL: Offers "Telco as a Service" and white-label eSIM plans via their Connect-API or fully branded QR codes, with coverage in over 190 countries, indicating strong support for white label solutions in markets like Germany.
  When looking for a white label SIM solution in Germany, consider:

  Your specific needs: Are you looking for consumer mobile services, IoT/M2M, or something else?
  Network coverage: Which German networks do you need access to (Telekom, Vodafone, O2)?
  Pricing model: Do they offer flexible tariffs, pay-as-you-go, or bundled packages?
  Management tools: How robust is their SIM management portal and API?
  Support: What kind of customer and technical support do they offer?
  It's recommended to contact these providers directly to discuss your specific requirements and receive tailored offers.

  gemini -> fairphone -> how they manage it

        It is not easy for any company to enter the smartphone market without potentially encountering many patents. The industry is rife with "standard essential patents" (SEPs) which cover technologies deemed essential for a product to comply with industry standards (like 5G or Bluetooth). Holders of SEPs are generally obliged to license them on "Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory" (FRAND) terms. However, obtaining these licenses can be challenging and lead to disputes.

        Fairphone has acknowledged this challenge:

        Fairphone's CEO, Eva Goudens, stated that the company has "struggled in the past to obtain FRAND licenses and faced litigation threats from patent intermediaries." This highlights the difficulty even for companies with a specific mission like Fairphone.
        Fairphone explicitly mentions "Royalties to patent holders, IP licenses" as part of their cost breakdown, indicating they engage in licensing agreements.
        They also proactively work to manage intellectual property rights within their supply chain and create reserves for potential future royalty payments and legal costs.
        Fairphone has also applied for their own patents (five design patents and two utility patents) for their modular architecture and connectors, showing a defensive and strategic approach to IP.
        Their modular design, which emphasizes repairability and longevity, also indirectly helps in a patent-heavy environment. While not directly avoiding patents, it differentiates them by focusing on product lifecycle rather than rapid feature iteration, which is often a driver of new patenting by larger competitors.

        In what countries do they operate?
        Fairphone primarily operates in Europe. They ship to a wide range of European countries, including:

        Austria

        While their primary focus is Europe, they have made some tentative steps into other markets, such as the USA through a partnership with Murena for the Fairphone 4. Some authorized resellers also ship Fairphones to other places, like Vireo (worldwide) and Palcom (Taiwan). However, they note that their devices are optimized for European cellular and 4G/LTE networks, and 5G is optimized for European 5G (Sub-6GHz), meaning mmWave 5G used in some other countries is not supported.


        How do they cope with bigger competition which might have more patents?
        Fairphone copes with bigger competition and their extensive patent portfolios by:

        Differentiating through their core mission: Fairphone's primary differentiator is its commitment to sustainability, ethical sourcing, modular design for repairability, and longevity. This appeals to a niche market of consumers who prioritize these values over having the latest, most feature-rich device. This focus shifts competition away from a "specs race" (where larger companies with vast R&D budgets and patent portfolios excel) to a values-based proposition.
        Focusing on a "fair" ecosystem: They actively work to establish transparent supply chains, source conflict-free and fair materials (tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold, cobalt, etc.), and improve working conditions. This ethical stance is a powerful brand differentiator.
        Modular Design and Longevity: By designing phones that are easy to repair and upgrade, Fairphone extends the lifespan of their devices. This directly counters the industry trend of rapid obsolescence and encourages consumers to keep their phones longer, reducing the environmental footprint. This also means less pressure to constantly innovate with entirely new, potentially patent-infringing, features.
        Strategic Licensing and IP Management: As mentioned, Fairphone acknowledges the need to pay royalties for essential patents. They actively manage their intellectual property, applying for their own patents to protect their unique design and architecture, and working with suppliers to understand and navigate the complex IP landscape. They also create financial reserves for potential legal costs related to patent negotiations.
        Community Engagement: Fairphone fosters a strong community of users who are invested in their mission. This loyalty and advocacy provide a strong base that is less susceptible to the marketing efforts of larger competitors.
        Operating within a specific niche: Instead of trying to compete head-on with giants like Apple and Samsung across all segments, Fairphone focuses on a segment of the market that values ethical consumption and repairability. This allows them to build a viable business model without needing to match the scale or patent breadth of the largest players.

// Hallo Herr Kurt Mülller,

// Ich habe ihr Interview  "Immunsystem am Limit" [1] gesehen.

// Sie sprechen z.B. davon gerne messen zu können, ob immunmodulierende Substanzen Gutes oder Böses tun.

// Ich will App schreiben, welche es erlaubt die Fitness von Menschen zu messen.
// Also das grau zwischen mir gehts gut oder Ich bin krank. Vielleicht gibts hier einfache Wege wie
// - Memory spielen, und messen wie lange man braucht
// - Bilder zeigen, bereits gesehen
// - schwache grau-Bilder erkennen soll auch funktonieren weil z.B. bei
//   Entzündungen die Augen schlechter durchblutet sind.

// Der erste Markttest eine von 1/16 Personen hat ja, gesagt, dass sie eine solche
// App nutzen würde.

// Wenn man die Daten der App teilt, kann man über Big-Data eben auch herausfinden
// wie schwer ist Covid, wo ist Covid schwer. Gibts Golfplätze mit Spritzmitteln
// in der Nähe oder Stickstoff-Verbindungen in der Luft oder Feintsaub (erste Reihe)

// Ihr Vortrag hat meine Vorstellung erweitert und bestärkt: Vielleicht kann man auch messen,
// ob das Immun-System gut funktioniert ? Und vielleicht kann man so auch helfen
// die Entscheidung zu treffen ab wann es sinnvoll ist einen Arzt zu besuchen zur
// Abklährung.

// Ich kenne einige Menschen auch schon vor 20 Jahren (mich selbst einbezogen)
// die auf einmal gesagt haben; Ich fühle mich nicht mehr so fit.

// Meine Idee war eigentlich ein einfaches Maß dafür zu finden, ob man normal
// altert oder schneller.

// Haben sie Interesse an einer Zusammenarbeit ?

            Having somewhat dry air is healthy for buildings otherwise mold
            builds up and eats the house.
            So we need a device telling when it makes sense to open the window.
            Now the amount of water air can carry depends on its temperature.
            Relative humidity tells how full the air is. 100% means it cannot take more.
            Eveerything above 80% means mold is likely which will damage your health.
            Now opening the window only makes sense if humidity outside is less than inside

            And on rainy daiys relative humidity is 100% thus 80% inside thus
            opening the window would not make a difference. Then eventually you
            have to increase heating.

            And when to heat when to open the window this device will tell you.

            Additionally in covid like times opening the window occasionally
            can reduce the amount of viruse floating through the air.
            And having enough oxygen is important. Like 2 dogs one man sleeping
            in a room can turn critical. So additionally CO2 will be measured
            maximize heath of inhabitants by telling to let in oxygen occasionally.
