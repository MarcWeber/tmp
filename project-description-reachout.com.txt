Imagine a platform reachout.com

(eg website and app)
-> and now you understand the means doing the work twice ?
That's why PHP / Wordpress sucks and is more than buzz (to me).

But maybe you can review the description and tell me what you
understand and what you don't understand.


STORY 1:
You can login and save the following profile information:

  login/password:
  contact-data: (text put phone/email skype whatsapp insta, whatever )
  name:
  image:
  My location: GPS lat/lon
  I am:
  looking for:
  not looking for:

===
STORY 2:
  After having logged in and entered your data
  you can identify the target audience
  cheap and fast without getting on anybodies nerves:


Start a reach out process (form)

  keywords/regex: 
    Example: "bus"

  location: 
    upolad shape file
    or multilne text "20 km around New York\nNew York"

  ai-filter:
    "Looking for bus companies"

  inquiry-text: (used by ai)
    "I want to explain you why we have the best bus leasing offers in north america"

  upload (voice or video)
  If people want to look at the inquiry be most personal
   
  [ identify target audience (no costs ) ]

PHASE 1:
  filter all people by keywords and location (because no AI it's
  cheap)

  Show something like 
  Applying location and keyword filter resulted in 
  200 people

  [ apply AI filter for (0.20 USD) ]

PHASE 2:
  After applying AI filter 30 people are left.

  [ run ai and generate match scores (0.05 USD) ]
  

PHASE 4:
  Your results

  10 = high match
  0 = no match

  10 Mr X, ..
  9 Mr X, ..
  0 Mr X, ..
  0 Mr X, ..



STORY 3:
  You can look at the people who reached out to you.
  out-reaches of others (only showing scores > 5)

  Mr X, .... , voice/text -> result 10



And the cool thing is. If you added some kind of 
business tracking or like system or rating ..
The requests could be given weight.  Like if you get a request
and you know 500 other parties this request turned into a business
relationship it would act as accelerator. So it would save time on all
sides.
