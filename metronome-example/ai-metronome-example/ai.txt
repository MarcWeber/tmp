Can you write the following JS / html code as index.html ?


loudness: slider
BPM: input (beats per minit) defaults to 60

divisions: textarea
Now here it turns interesting
each line contains characters.
All characters are one measure
upper characters are 100% loudness, lower case characters are 50%  loudness.
Z is high pitch a is low pitch

now the first line tells beats per measure.
Additional lines are arbitrary subdivisions.
. means silence.

Examples:

name: 4 beats in a measure
line1: Zaaa 

name: 3 beats in a measure with 8th subdivisioning
line1: Zaa
line2: .x.x.x

Now you see the second line is subdivisioning the measure into 6 pieces, not 3


name: Fun pattern
line1: ZaYaXa
line2: abcdefg


Also add a select which allows to select any of the given samples

This means base measure has 6 divisionings.
On top of that divide by 7.

So you need common divisor or such and then within a line divide 
the tick by that to find rest, if there is rest do nothing otherwise
start the next tone unless its '.'

then there must be [star/stop] button.

Now to make this work you must 
1) find all characters making noices and precalculate some wave form to play
2) find common subdivisioning of all lines within text area so that timer
   can be used to find the next tick 
3) if the next tick happens iterate over each line and if the tick position matches
   a character play that sound

The esult should be a metronome


pitch_range_frequencies_lower_upper = [100, 10000] so must be hearable to humans and 10000 ensures older peolpe still can hear everything .
